      <p>I wrote this Haiku about perseverance</p>
      <h2>Unyielding Path</h2>

    <h2>My personal interests</h2>
    <p>
      I am very curious by nature. The things that interest me are the unknown
      things. Is there life in this universe aside from us? Will we travel to
      other solar systems and colonize other planets? How long would it take for
      us to reach the nearest habitable planet?
    </p>
    <p>
      Technology is advancing at an accelerated rate, and it fascinates me.
      Thatâ€™s why I decided to study computer science. I hope one day to be a
      part of a major project that has the potential to change the way we live
      our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bioengineering is another area of interest. I read this book called
      <em>Lifespan</em> by David A. Sinclair, and in it, he claims that one day
      death will be a thing of the past. Sinclair believes that through science,
      we will be able to reverse the aging process. I hope he is right, because
      I like living, and if I could live forever, maybe I would get to visit
      another planet and encounter other life forms. &#128514;
